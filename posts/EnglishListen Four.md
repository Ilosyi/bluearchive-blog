## Long conversation 1
M:I love working out!
W:Ugh! You're sweating all over the floor..
M: I just ran five miles! A friend told me about this great park on Jefferson Street.I love exploring new parks!
W: I try running at the gym three days a week, but it's so boring looking at the TV monitor or the
wall in front of me for an hour.
M: You should run outside! Being in nature, enjoying the beautiful flowers and the trees, I feel my
mind relax and the stress just falls away.
W: It is nice outside.My mom loves t'ai chi and a nearby t'ai chi group meets every morning at 6
a.m. I've tried going, but it's too early for me to get out of bed
M: T'ai chi is really good. You need some kind of exercise. It's unhealthy for you to sit in front of your computer all day, every day!
W:Well,I recently spend my weekends away from my computer
M: Oh really? And what have you done recently that didn't involve a computer or TV screen?
W:Pandas! I just went to the San Diego Zoo with my sister on Saturday! They have one of the best panda exhibits in the US. The mother panda is from Wolong, China, and had had six baby pandas by 2012 since arriving at the San Diego Zoo in September of 1996.
M: Oh,I bet baby pandas are amazing! Hey! Maybe you should get a zoo membership and jogging in the zoo!
W: A zoo membership! Now that's a great idea! I love the San Diego Zoo. It's near my house, I can get good exercise and I can watch the baby pandas grow up!

M: 我喜欢锻炼！
W: 哎呀！你把地板弄得全是汗。
M: 我刚跑了五英里！一个朋友告诉我在杰斐逊街上有一个很棒的公园。我喜欢探索新的公园！
W: 我尝试每周三天在健身房跑步，但看着电视屏幕或前面的墙一个小时真是太无聊了。
M: 你应该到外面跑步！在大自然中，享受美丽的花朵和树木，我感觉我的心情放松了，压力也消散了。
W: 外面确实很不错。我妈妈喜欢太极，附近的一个太极小组每天早上6点都会聚会。我尝试过去，但太早了，我起不来。
M: 太极真的很好。你需要做一些运动。每天整天坐在电脑前对你身体不好！
W: 好吧，我最近周末都远离电脑。
M: 哦，真的吗？那你最近做了什么不涉及电脑或电视屏幕的事？
W: 熊猫！我上周六刚和我姐姐去了圣地亚哥动物园！他们有美国最好的熊猫展览之一。熊猫妈妈来自中国卧龙，自1996年9月到达圣地亚哥动物园以来，到2012年已经生了六只熊猫宝宝。
M: 哦，我敢打赌熊猫宝宝很棒！嘿！也许你应该办个动物园会员卡，在动物园里跑步！
W: 动物园会员卡！这是个好主意！我喜欢圣地亚哥动物园。它离我家很近，我可以好好锻炼，还能看着熊猫宝宝长大！

## Passage 1
Have you ever felt you don't have enough hours in the day? Or that you'd give anything for a whole day to catch up with yourself? Well, here are some ideas that work for me.
First of all, make a to-do list every day and set clear priorities. The trick here isn't making the list;that's the easy part. The trick is making the priorities. I look at my list and put a star next to anything that is really urgent.Then I put the number2 next to anything that will just take a couple of minutes. I actually do these quick tasks before I get on with the urgent ones; it's a bit like clearing off the top of your desk before sitting down to write that important letter
Second, know when is the most productive time of day for you and do your work or study then. One of the shocking discoveries I made about myself is that if I get up at 5 a.m., I can do a day's work and even fit breakfast in before half past nine. Of course, if you are an early bird, it can be difficult to accomplish tasks that involve phoning "night owls", but that's what email's for!
Finally, do not let your inbox run your life.I just realized recently how frequently I interrupted my real work to check my inbox and respond to the most trivial of emails.So.now I only open it when
absolutely necessary and this saves me hours. If your work depends on you being constantly accessible by email,then you can't do this;but be honest and ask yourself,Am I an email addict?With these simple, practical techniques, you will become more efficient, less stressed and be able to win some"me-time"for yourself.

你有没有感觉一天中的时间不够用？或者你愿意付出一切换来整整一天的时间来赶上自己的进度？好吧，这里有一些对我有效的建议。
首先，每天列一个待办事项清单并设定明确的优先级。这里的诀窍不是制作清单；那是简单的部分。诀窍在于设定优先级。我查看我的清单，并在任何非常紧急的事项旁边打上星号。然后，我在只需要几分钟完成的事项旁边标上数字2。我实际上会在处理紧急事项之前先完成这些快速任务；这有点像在坐下来写那封重要信之前清理你的书桌。
其次，知道一天中对你来说最有效率的时间，并在那个时间工作或学习。我对自己所做的一个令人震惊的发现是，如果我在早上5点起床，我可以在九点半之前完成一天的工作，甚至还能吃早餐。当然，如果你是早起的鸟儿，完成需要打电话给“夜猫子”的任务可能会很困难，但这就是为什么有电子邮件的存在！
最后，不要让你的收件箱控制你的生活。我最近才意识到我多么频繁地中断实际工作去检查收件箱并回复最琐碎的邮件。所以，现在我只有在绝对必要的时候才打开它，这为我节省了几个小时。如果你的工作依赖于你通过电子邮件不断保持联系，那么你不能这样做；但要诚实地问自己，我是邮件上瘾者吗？通过这些简单、实用的技巧，你将变得更有效率，压力更小，并能够为自己赢得一些“自我时间”。

## Long conversation 1
M: Nancy, time to make a birthday wish!
W: I wish ... hmm. OK! I want a high-paying job, a husband with a perfect face and body, and a big house ... with a swimming pool!
M: Wow, Nancy! Those are your three wishes?
W: Of course! If I have those three things, I’ll be happy!
M: Now, Nancy. Let me tell you my story, and you may see things differently.
W: “See things differently?”What do you mean, Uncle Charlie?
M: Here is what I once experienced in life. When I married, 32 years ago, we had a happy marriage, a beautiful house, two expensive cars, and $200,000 in the bank!
W: See, just like now!
M: Wait! I would suggest three different wishes!
W: Well ... What would you wish for? You’re older and wiser!
M: What happens if you lose your job, lose your house, and your husband becomes sick? I suggest these three wishes: patience, courage and love!
W: Patience, courage and love?
M: Yes! If you have patience and courage, you and your husband will have good jobs and a nice house. And if you have true love, you and your husband will be beautiful to each other no matter how old you become together.
W: This is good.
M: Within six years of our marriage, we had three beautiful children, but we lost our jobs, our house, all our money, and then I got really sick for nine years. But we didn’t lose anything truly valuable, because we always said: “Wherever the five of us are together, we are at home!”And, little by little things did improve, and I finally got well. Patience, courage and love! These are what make life full, strong and happy!
W: Hmm, I will remember. Patience, courage and love! Thanks, Uncle Charlie!

M: 南希，许个生日愿望吧！
W: 我希望……嗯，好吧！我想要一份高薪的工作，一个长得完美的老公，还有一栋带游泳池的大房子！
M: 哇，南希！这是你的三个愿望吗？
W: 当然了！如果我有这三样东西，我就会很幸福！
M: 好吧，南希。让我给你讲讲我的故事，你可能会有不同的看法。
W: “有不同的看法？”你什么意思，查理叔叔？
M: 这是我曾经的人生经历。32年前我结婚时，我们有一个幸福的婚姻，一个漂亮的房子，两辆昂贵的车，还有银行里20万美元！
W: 看，这不就像现在一样吗！
M: 等等！我会建议三个不同的愿望！
W: 嗯……你会许什么愿望？你年长又智慧！
M: 如果你失去了工作，失去了房子，你的丈夫生病了怎么办？我建议这三个愿望：耐心、勇气和爱！
W: 耐心、勇气和爱？
M: 是的！如果你有耐心和勇气，你和你的丈夫会有好的工作和漂亮的房子。而如果你有真爱，无论你们一起变得多老，你们在对方面前都会是美丽的。
W: 这很好。
M: 我们结婚六年后，拥有了三个漂亮的孩子，但我们失去了工作、房子、所有的钱，然后我病了九年。但是我们没有失去任何真正有价值的东西，因为我们总是说：“只要我们五个人在一起，我们就在家！”然后，情况一点一点地改善了，我终于康复了。耐心、勇气和爱！这些才是让生活充实、坚强和幸福的关键！
W: 嗯，我会记住的。耐心、勇气和爱！谢谢你，查理叔叔！

## Passage 1

If you think that you have to live up a remote mountain in order to live a long and healthy life, a religious community in Loma Linda, California, may prove you wrong. Its members are a group of Christians known as the Seventh-day Adventists. The Adventists enjoy a much higher life expectancy than average Californians. Adventist men can expect to live about seven years longer than other Californian men. Adventist women are likely to live around four years longer than other Californian women. The Adventists also act much younger than they are and see doctors much less than ordinary people.
So what’s the secret of the Adventists’longevity? It is not all in their genes. Nor is their good health a mere accident. The Adventists live longer partly because they have a vegetable-based diet. Around 35 percent of them are vegetarian, and around one half eat meat only rarely. Tobacco and alcohol consumptions are discouraged. So are rich or spicy foods, meat, and drinks containing caffeine. The Adventist diet is high in fruit and vegetables. It also includes plenty of whole grains, nuts, seeds and beans, and water is the drink of choice.
The longevity of the Adventists is also related to their lifestyle and natural environment. They believe in having regular exercise, helping others, and maintaining strong social and familial ties. They live in a mild climate with warm summers and cool winters. Interestingly, the air quality of Loma Linda, however, is not as good as in other longevity hot spots. This should give us all hope, as it suggests that we don’t have to have every single factor in place in order to achieve excellent health. Despite this, the Adventists’good health certainly provides strong evidence that diet and lifestyle choices have a great impact on health and longevity.
如果你认为必须住在偏远的山上才能长寿健康，加利福尼亚洛马琳达的一个宗教社区可能会让你改变看法。这个社区的成员是一群被称为基督复临安息日会的基督徒。他们的平均寿命远高于普通加州人。基督复临安息日会的男性预期寿命比其他加州男性长约七年，而女性则比其他加州女性长约四年。他们的行动也比实际年龄显得年轻得多，看医生的次数也远少于普通人。
那么，基督复临安息日会长寿的秘密是什么呢？这并不仅仅是因为他们的基因，也不是偶然的健康。基督复临安息日会的成员长寿部分归功于他们的植物性饮食。大约35%的人是素食主义者，约一半的人很少吃肉。吸烟和饮酒受到抑制，富含脂肪或辛辣的食物、肉类以及含咖啡因的饮料也是如此。基督复临安息日会的饮食中富含水果和蔬菜，还包括大量的全谷物、坚果、种子和豆类，水是他们的首选饮品。
基督复临安息日会的长寿还与他们的生活方式和自然环境有关。他们相信定期锻炼、帮助他人以及维持强大的社会和家庭联系。他们生活在夏季温暖、冬季凉爽的温和气候中。有趣的是，洛马琳达的空气质量并不像其他长寿热点地区那样好。这给了我们所有人希望，因为这表明我们不必具备所有因素就能达到健康长寿。尽管如此，基督复临安息日会的良好健康状况确实强有力地证明了饮食和生活方式选择对健康和长寿有巨大的影响。

## Long conversation 1
M: Rebecca, I just learned of an amazing park right here near our city!
W: Really? Is it a nature park or an entertainment park?
M: It’s a beautiful nature park, located 15 miles from our home.ar
W: What’s it called?
M: It is called Big Sky Park and has nice walking trails and camping sites!
W: Bill, this is perfect! We can have a vacation and still keep saving money to visit my family sometime. But, can we get to Big Sky Park without a car?
M: Yes, easily. We just take the No. 32 bus that goes right to the park. The only problem will be getting all of our camping stuff with us on the bus.
W: Well, I did just buy that new cart to help carry groceries home on the bus, plus we have your big backpack. Together, I think we will be fine. All of our camping equipment should easily fit on the bus.
M: Good. Good! I know we can make it a really special weekend. I have longed for a time when we could walk alone together in the quiet beauty of nature. I’m so, so happy to have this chance to be with you at the park.
W: I know me too! I know what I’ll do! I’ll pack all of our favorite food, and I’ll bake a small chocolate cake. Your favorite! Then we can drink tea and eat the chocolate cake around a campfire. I’m so happy you found Big Sky Park. I can’t wait, just two more days for the weekend to come!
M: I’m so happy as well. Big Sky Park will be wonderful. The fire, the dinner and spending time with you make me such a happy, happy man, Rebecca!
M: Rebecca，我刚刚得知我们城市附近有一个令人惊叹的公园！
W: 真的吗？是自然公园还是娱乐公园？
M: 这是一个美丽的自然公园，距离我们家15英里。
W: 它叫什么名字？
M: 它叫“大天空公园”，有很棒的步道和露营地！
W: 比尔，这太完美了！我们可以去度假，同时还能继续存钱，以后去看望我的家人。但我们没有车，能到“大天空公园”吗？
M: 可以的，很方便。我们只需乘坐32路公交车，它直接到公园。唯一的问题是如何把我们所有的露营装备带上公交车。
W: 嗯，我刚买了那个新的小推车来帮忙把食品带回家，加上你的大背包。我觉得我们应该没问题。我们所有的露营设备应该都能轻松带上车。
M: 太好了，太好了！我知道我们能度过一个非常特别的周末。我一直渴望能在大自然的静谧美景中与你独处。我真的很高兴能有这个机会和你一起去公园。
W: 我也一样！我知道我会做什么！我要打包我们最喜欢的食物，还会烤一个小巧克力蛋糕。你最喜欢的！然后我们可以在篝火旁边喝茶吃蛋糕。我真高兴你发现了“大天空公园”。我等不及了，只剩两天就到周末了！
M: 我也非常高兴。“大天空公园”一定会很棒。篝火、晚餐，还有和你在一起，让我觉得非常非常幸福，Rebecca！
## Passage 1
A new museum entirely dedicated to laziness has opened in the capital city of Colombia. But you have to hurry if you want to see the exhibits and find out about being lazy because the exhibition lasts only for one week. The unusual show displays a whole range of things such as sofas, beds and anything that makes you feel like taking a rest. There are also plenty of televisions for those visiting couch potatoes to watch as they move around relaxingly in the museum.
It is no coincidence but rather an intentional decision for the museum to have opened right after the holiday season. The idea is for people to think about laziness, and perhaps change their behavior and lifestyle throughout the rest of the year. It offers a practical experience to make us think about laziness in our high-speed, fast-paced societies.
The museum’s founder Marcela Arrieta said she wanted people to rethink about laziness and decide whether it really is a bad thing. She told the media that people today always think about laziness as an enemy of work. For example, they may feel guilty if they sleep late, or they may feel they are wasting time after taking a nap or having a holiday.
Ms. Arrieta may not be proposing that we should have a shorter working week, but she could have a point in that we do need more leisure time than our jobs allow us, and change our lifestyle to a type that is more relaxing. Besides, according to scientists, avoiding the pressure and stress of work can make us healthier and live longer. So, why not try out Ms. Arrieta’s advice for yourself, slow down, and think about being lazy?
一个全新博物馆专门致力于懒惰，已经在哥伦比亚首都开幕。但是如果你想参观展览并了解懒惰的相关信息，必须抓紧时间，因为展览仅持续一周。这场特别的展览展示了各种让你想休息的物品，如沙发、床等等。博物馆内还有大量的电视供参观的“沙发土豆”在放松移动时观看。
博物馆选择在节日季后开幕并非偶然，而是一个有意的决定。这个想法是让人们思考懒惰，并可能在余下的一年中改变他们的行为和生活方式。它提供了一种实践体验，让我们在高速快节奏的社会中思考懒惰。
博物馆的创始人Marcela Arrieta表示，她希望人们重新思考懒惰，并决定懒惰是否真的那么糟糕。她对媒体说，如今人们总是把懒惰视为工作的敌人。例如，他们可能会因为睡懒觉而感到内疚，或者在打盹或度假后觉得自己在浪费时间。
Arrieta女士可能并没有建议我们应该缩短工作周，但她认为我们确实需要比工作所允许的更多的休闲时间，并且改变我们的生活方式，使其更加放松。此外，根据科学家的说法，避免工作压力和紧张可以使我们更健康，寿命更长。所以，为什么不亲自尝试一下Arrieta女士的建议，放慢脚步，思考一下懒惰呢？

## Long conversation 1
W: Hey, John! Everything OK? You look upset.
M: Oh, hi Kate. I was in the cafeteria eating alone. James from accounting walked by, sat down to eat at the table right next to me –didn’t say a single word to me. I wondered why.
W: Is that the main thing stressing you out, John?
M: No, I was silly to feel bad about that. What I am stressed about is my workload. My manager, Steven, is a great guy. He always counts on me to get the work done. But I have five meetings this week and two big projects to complete by next Monday. I don’t see how I can finish. I’m really worried I’ll let my team down.
W: I have some free time on Friday and over the weekend. I can help you with your extra work if you’d like. I know that feeling of being overwhelmed with work. It’s awful. I’d like to help. 
M: Really? You’d do that for me?
W: Of course I will! John, a lot of us really admire your work. Some of us have asked to work on your team. You’re a great example to us, John. You shouldn’t doubt yourself. I’m glad to help out.
M: Wow, Kate. Thanks!
W: We could ... discuss it over dinner on Thursday. My treat!
M: Wow. No ... I mean I get to buy dinner, Kate! How about the new restaurant on 6th Street, 365?
It’s called 365 because it offers local, seasonal foods –fall, winter, spring, and summer –healthy choices with wonderful fresh fruits and vegetables. Let’s meet at 7 p.m.
W: Sounds wonderful! Thursday, 7 p.m. at the new restaurant 365 on 6th Street. Perfect!
W: 嘿，约翰！一切都好吗？你看起来很不开心。
M: 哦，嗨，凯特。我在自助餐厅吃饭时独自一人。会计部的詹姆斯走过来，坐在我旁边的桌子上，一句话都没和我说。我不知道为什么。
W: 这是主要让你感到压力的事情吗，约翰？
M: 不是的，我觉得为此而感到不快真是愚蠢。让我压力山大的是我的工作量。我的经理史蒂文人很好。他总是依赖我完成工作。但是我这周有五场会议，还有两个大项目要在下周一之前完成。我真不知道怎么完成。我很担心会让团队失望。
W: 我周五和周末有些空闲时间。如果你愿意，我可以帮你处理额外的工作。我理解被工作压得喘不过气的感觉，真的很难受。我想帮忙。
M: 真的吗？你愿意这么做？
W: 当然愿意！约翰，我们很多人都非常钦佩你的工作。有些人甚至要求加入你的团队。你是我们的楷模，你不应该怀疑自己。我很高兴能帮忙。
M: 哇，凯特，谢谢！
W: 我们可以……在周四的晚餐时讨论一下。我请客！
M: 哇，不……我请客，凯特！要不要去第六大街的新餐厅365？它以当地时令食材命名——秋、冬、春、夏——健康的选择，新鲜美味的水果和蔬菜。我们七点见面吧。
W: 听起来太棒了！周四晚上七点，在第六大街的新餐厅365。太完美了！
## Passage 1
More than half of working Americans are dissatisfied with their jobs, according to a survey. That’s bad news for employers because workers’discontent can hurt productivity and hinder innovation. Lynn Franco, co-author of the report, says Americans’job satisfaction is at its lowest level in more than two decades: Only 45.3 percent of workers say they are satisfied with their jobs compared with 61 percent in 1987.
The report was produced by the Conference Board, a non-profit organization that helps businesses strengthen their performance. It is based on a survey of 5,000 US households. It shows a drop in satisfaction in many aspects of an employee’s work life, including interest in the job, dealing with co-workers and bosses, commuting and job security. As a group, neither young people who are just entering the workforce nor employees who are about to retire, Franco says, arehappy with what they do.
Only about 36 percent of workers under the age of 25 say they are currently satisfied with their jobs. And it’s not much better among baby boomers. Twenty years ago, more than 50 percent of baby boomers were satisfied. Today, that’s down to 46 percent.
The most satisfied group of workers in the survey was those aged 25 to 34. Franco suggests that they may see some opportunities for upward mobility as baby boomers retire.
The Conference Board survey also asked about the reasons behind job dissatisfaction. There are economic reasons such as wages, promotion policy and bonus policy that are sort of adding to this level of dissatisfaction. In addition, workers are also dissatisfied with the benefits: vacation policy, family-related leave time, work schedule flexibility, and a variety of other factors as well.

根据一项调查，超过一半的美国工作人员对自己的工作不满意。这对雇主来说是个坏消息，因为工人的不满可能会影响生产力并阻碍创新。报告的共同作者琳恩·弗兰科表示，美国人的工作满意度已经降到了二十多年来的最低水平：仅有45.3%的工人表示他们对工作感到满意，而1987年这一比例为61%。
这份报告由会议委员会（Conference Board）发布，该组织是一个非营利性机构，致力于帮助企业提升业绩。报告基于对5000个美国家庭的调查，显示出员工在工作生活的多个方面都感到满意度下降，包括对工作的兴趣、与同事和上司的相处、通勤和工作安全感等。弗兰科指出，无论是刚进入职场的年轻人还是即将退休的员工，都对自己的工作感到不满意。
只有大约36%的25岁以下的工人表示目前对自己的工作感到满意。而婴儿潮一代也不比他们好多少。20年前，超过50%的婴儿潮一代感到满意，而今天这一比例降至46%。
调查显示，最满意的工作群体是25至34岁的员工。弗兰科推测，他们可能看到了随着婴儿潮一代退休的一些晋升机会。
会议委员会的调查还询问了导致工作不满的原因。经济原因如工资、晋升政策和奖金政策，都在一定程度上增加了不满的水平。此外，员工对福利也感到不满：如假期政策、与家庭相关的请假时间、工作时间的灵活性，以及其他各种因素。

W: This feels like a dream ... The last time I was in San Francisco was 30 years ago, when I was your age, 15 years old. So much has changed in the city–but you know–many of the sites are just the same.
M: Wow! San Francisco is as beautiful as a picture! I can’t believe it! Let’s get going! Let’s look at the map and take the streetcar to the Golden Gate Bridge.
W: Yes, of course. But, wait–let’s just take a moment to look at the Golden Gate Bridge from here–up high on the hill. See how amazing the sun looks, shining on the bridge there high above the water? Sometimes the best way to really enjoy something is to see it from different angles and perspectives.
M: Yes! Just beautiful from here! OK! Let’s get going! Wait! You know what, Aunt Lucy, I’m really, really hungry! May we eat before we head out to see the Golden Gate Bridge?
W: Yes, of course we can. We’re already here in Chinatown and near my favorite Chinese restaurant. Even after 30 years have passed since I last visited, it’s still busy and active.
M: That’s great, Aunt Lucy!
W: And, it’s right here!
M: Wow! This is amazing! The man inside the window is making noodles by hand–just by pulling on the flour dough. I’ve never seen anything like it before. How?
W: Yes, I know. It’s amazing, right? And the food is delicious, too! Sometimes the best way to enjoy culture is to simply slow down and truly experience it. We have five full days here in San Francisco. Let’s go slowly and enjoy every moment!
W: 这感觉就像在梦里一样……我上次来旧金山是30年前，那时候我和你现在一样大，15岁。这座城市变化太大了，但你知道，很多地方还是一样的。
M: 哇！旧金山美得像一幅画！我简直不敢相信！我们出发吧！我们看看地图，坐电车去金门大桥吧。
W: 当然可以。但是，等一下，我们先从这里，站在高高的山上，看看金门大桥。看看太阳如何照耀在高高的桥上，高高地悬在水面上？有时候真正享受一样东西的最好方法就是从不同的角度和视角去看它。
M: 对！从这里看真的太美了！好！我们出发吧！等等！你知道吗，露西阿姨，我真的好饿好饿！我们去看金门大桥之前可以吃点东西吗？
W: 当然可以。我们已经在唐人街附近了，我的最爱中餐馆也在这附近。即使我离开这里已经30年了，唐人街还是繁华和活跃的。
M: 太好了，露西阿姨！
W: 它就在这里！
M: 哇！太神奇了！窗里面的人在拉面条，只是简单地用手拉面团。我从未见过这样的场景。怎么做到的？
W: 是的，我知道。这太神奇了，对吧？而且食物也很美味！有时候享受文化的最好方式就是慢下来，真正地去体验它。我们在旧金山有五天的时间。让我们慢慢来，享受每一个时刻吧！

## Passage 1
The Mona Lisa is probably the most famous painting in the world. It was created by Leonardo da Vinci, the famous Italian artist, between around 1503 and 1506. The subject is the wife of a wealthy silk merchant of Italy. The woman’s husband requested Da Vinci to portray her as a celebration of their home’s completion and the birth of their second son. What is it about this painting that has created such a lasting impact on the artistic world?
One factor is the artist himself. Leonardo da Vinci was not only an artist, but also a scientist, an architect and an engineer. His knowledge of the human form came from the study of actual human bodies, so he was able to draw and paint it more accurately.
Another factor is the material used for the painting. The Mona Lisa is an oil painting, but unlike other paintings, which are usually created on canvas, the Mona Lisa has a wood panel as the surface. The use of a wood panel makes it possible for the work to have survived for centuries.
Lastly, the style and techniques used for the painting make the Mona Lisa a masterpiece. Da Vinci presented precise details in the subject’s hands and face. He applied a shadowing technique at the corners of her lips and her eyes, which gives her an unbelievably lifelike appearance. He also created a background with aerial views and a beautiful landscape. His remarkable skills left behind no visible brush marks at all.
All these factors–Da Vinci’s talent, the medium used for the painting, the style and techniques applied in the work–contribute to the lasting and mysterious beauty of the Mona Lisa.
《蒙娜丽莎》可能是世界上最著名的绘画作品。它是由著名意大利艺术家莱昂纳多·达·芬奇在大约1503年至1506年间创作的。这幅画的主题是意大利一位富有的丝绸商人的妻子。这位女士的丈夫请求达·芬奇将她描绘出来，以庆祝他们家完成的建筑和他们第二个儿子的诞生。这幅画作为何能在艺术世界产生如此深远的影响？
一个因素是艺术家本身。莱昂纳多·达·芬奇不仅是一位艺术家，还是一位科学家、建筑师和工程师。他对人体结构的深入研究使他能够更准确地描绘和绘制人体。
另一个因素是绘画所用的材料。《蒙娜丽莎》是一幅油画，但与通常用帆布创作的其他画作不同，蒙娜丽莎的表面是木板。使用木板作为表面材料使得这幅作品能够保存数个世纪。
最后，该绘画的风格和技巧使得《蒙娜丽莎》成为一件杰作。达·芬奇在主体的手和脸部呈现了精确的细节。他在她的嘴角和眼睛周围采用了阴影技法，使她看起来非常生动逼真。他还创造了一个具有空中视角和美丽风景的背景。他出色的技艺使得整幅作品几乎看不到任何明显的笔触。
达·芬奇的才华、绘画所用的材料、以及作品中应用的风格和技巧，所有这些因素共同促成了《蒙娜丽莎》持久而神秘的美感。

W: Hey Billy! It’s 7:30 p.m.! Turn off your TV and computer. Come down to dinner. It seems your father is finishing his conference call with his team in China.
M: OK Mom. Coming. But why is Dad on his computer while I can’t be on mine!
W: Billy, your father is working. But you are chatting with your friends about celebrities!
So your father needs to be on his computer. And you don’t!
M: OK. Sorry, Mom. What are we having for dinner? Pizza?
W: Pizza?! I’ve made us a nice dinner of roast chicken, mushroom soup and vegetable salad. I even made chocolate cake for dessert –and you want pizza!
M: Just kidding Mom! I love your cooking! Mmm I’m hungry, and it smells delicious!
W: Billy! I told you to shut down all electronics!
M: Mom! This isn’t fair. You told me to turn off my computer and my TV –you didn’t say all electronics –and you didn’t mention my cell phone! I have to check the news! My favorite golf player just got in trouble for drunk driving! Please Mom! I have to find out!
W: You can’t go five minutes without having your eyes on a screen! Hand me your phone. Now! I am turning it off so we can have a nice dinner.
M: OK Mom. Fine! Here’s my phone.
W: Now, where is your father?
M: Will you make Dad do the same? We never have family dinner anymore without Dad being on electronics!
W: Hmm, you know, Billy, you have a very good point. I think it’s time we had family dinner without any electronics. Here’s our new rule: Just for 45 minutes over dinner, no electronics!
W: 嘿，比利！现在是晚上7:30了！关掉电视和电脑，来吃晚饭。你爸爸好像正在和他在中国的团队进行电话会议。
M: 好的，妈妈。我来了。但为什么爸爸可以用电脑，而我不能用我的呢！
W: 比利，你爸爸在工作。但你只是在和朋友聊明星！
M: 好吧，对不起，妈妈。我们晚饭吃什么？披萨吗？
W: 披萨？！我做了一顿烤鸡、蘑菇汤和蔬菜沙拉的美味晚餐。我甚至做了巧克力蛋糕作为甜点 —— 你居然想吃披萨！
M: 妈妈，开玩笑的！我喜欢你做的饭菜！嗯，我好饿，味道好香！
W: 比利！我告诉过你关掉所有电子设备！
M: 妈妈！这不公平。你让我关掉电脑和电视，你没说所有电子设备，也没提我的手机！我得查看新闻！我最喜欢的高尔夫球选手刚因为酒驾出了事！妈妈！我必须知道！
W: 你连五分钟都离不开屏幕！把你的手机交给我。现在！我要关掉它，这样我们才能好好吃顿晚饭。
M: 好的，妈妈。好吧！这是我的手机。
W: 现在，你爸爸在哪里？
M: 你让爸爸也这样做吗？我们家几乎没有家庭晚餐不被爸爸的电子设备打扰！
W: 嗯，比利，你说得对。我觉得我们应该在没有电子设备的情况下共进晚餐。这里是我们的新规定：只在晚餐时间内的45分钟，不用电子设备！
## Passage 1
We as a society have intense interest in the celebrity news prevalent in our media. One of the key reasons is that in a world of constant death and disasters, celebrity news allows us to escape from the “real news”. After all, the job of celebrities is to entertain us, so it’s only natural that news about them would be a source of entertainment as well.
Of course the world isn’t always a depressing place filled with death, danger and sad events. But the media presents a dominant coverage of them. Watching hours of that news makes you depressed and want something different. This is why celebrity news fills that need for “happy news”or “light news”.
Celebrities also tend to live life on the edge and overdo everything they are engaged in. They long for attention and will do whatever to get it. We watch them with fascination as they party, do drugs, escape the law, get caught by the law, get married or divorced, and so forth.
Many people became attracted by the lifestyle of celebrities because they more or less wish they had the same lives as the stars. Celebrity news fuels people’s desire to look like the stars, dress like the stars, and even name children after the stars. It can be a source of making every life decision for some people. Although this may not be a healthy thing to do, it does boost the celebrity news business.
In a word, celebrity news gives us a well-needed break from the depressing and harsh news stories that we are flooded with daily. But as viewers and readers we need to keep in mind that celebrities are still common people, and that their lives are in many ways similar to ours, not merely to be shown for entertainment only.
作为一个社会，我们对媒体中充斥的名人新闻表现出极大的兴趣。其中一个主要原因是，在一个充满着不断的死亡和灾难的世界中，名人新闻让我们能够逃离“真正的新闻”。毕竟，名人的工作就是娱乐我们，所以关于他们的新闻也自然成为一种娱乐来源。
当然，世界并不总是一个充满死亡、危险和悲伤事件的地方。但媒体却主要报道这些内容。看了几个小时的这些新闻会让你感到沮丧，渴望得到些不同的信息。这就是为什么名人新闻填补了人们对“快乐新闻”或“轻松新闻”的需求。
名人往往过着充满刺激的生活，无论他们参与什么活动，都会过度。他们渴望关注，并且会不择手段地获取关注。我们以极大的兴趣观察他们参加派对、吸毒、逃避法律、被法律追捕、结婚或离婚等种种行为。
很多人被名人的生活方式吸引，因为他们多多少少希望自己也能过上明星们的生活。名人新闻助长了人们想要像明星一样看起来、穿着，甚至为孩子取名的欲望。对一些人来说，这甚至可能成为每个生活决策的依据。尽管这可能并不是健康的行为，但它确实促进了名人新闻业务的发展。
总之，名人新闻给了我们一个迫切需要的休息，远离每天充斥着的令人沮丧和严酷的新闻故事。但作为观众和读者，我们需要牢记，名人也只是普通人，他们的生活在许多方面与我们相似，不仅仅是用来娱乐的对象。

## Long conversation 1
M: Have you heard? A big storm is coming! 
W: Yes! The weatherman says a hurricane is coming! Even though our city is 50 miles from the  ocean, we will still be in the path of the hurricane. 
M: I heard it on the radio news, too! We need to prepare. There’s an Emergency Items list on the  refrigerator. I’ll get it. 
W: OK. Be prepared to be without food, water or electricity. 
M: So the list says one gallon of water per person per day. It also says we need to get food that doesn’t need refrigeration. 
W: How many days of supplies should we get? 
M: It says to prepare emergency supplies for 10 days. 
W: Well, we have four flashlights already. 
M: Yes, but we need batteries for the flashlights. 
W: OK, so let’s get ready and go to the store. I hope everyone else in town hasn’t already bought out the store for their own supplies. Should we bring cash, in case the credit card machines don’t work? 
M: Yep! I already went by the bank this morning. I have $1,500 cash on hand. So, scratch off  flashlights and cash from our Emergency Items list. 
W: Hmm, you know, if we don’t use the $1,500 cash for the storm – I could easily find a use for it  shopping at the mall. There’s a beautiful new suit and shoes and an amazing long coat and ... 
M: Hahaha. Hmm let’s see: $1,500 is $1,300 more than our budget for clothing expenses per  month! Remember that we took this cash from our emergency savings account – my sweet love – so that we would be prepared in an emergency. Shopping in the mall is not an  emergency! 

M: 你听说了吗？一场大风暴要来了！
W: 是的！天气预报说一场飓风要来了！尽管我们的城市距离海洋有50英里，但我们仍会在飓风路径上。
M: 我也在广播新闻上听到了！我们需要做好准备。冰箱上有一个紧急物品清单。我去拿一下。
W: 好的。准备好没有食物、水或电的情况。
M: 清单上说每人每天需要一加仑水。还说我们需要购买不需要冷藏的食物。
W: 我们应该准备多少天的物资？
M: 清单上建议准备十天的紧急物资。
W: 嗯，我们已经有四个手电筒了。
M: 是的，但我们需要为手电筒准备电池。
W: 好的，那么让我们准备好，去商店吧。我希望城里其他人还没有把商店里的物品买光。我们要带现金吗，以防信用卡机器不工作？
M: 对！今天早上我已经去过银行了。我手头上有1500美元现金。所以，把手电筒和现金从我们的紧急物品清单上划掉。
W: 嗯，你知道，如果我们不用这1500美元来准备风暴的话，我完全可以在购物中心找到用途。那里有一套漂亮的新衣服、鞋子和一件漂亮的长外套……
M: 哈哈哈。嗯，让我想想：1500美元比我们每月的服装开支预算多了1300美元！记住，我们是从紧急储蓄账户取出这笔现金的，亲爱的，这是为了在紧急情况下做好准备。在购物中心购物不是紧急情况！
Passage 1
Shoplifting is a common problem faced by retail businesses that can have a bad effect on their profitability. Retail businesses earn revenue by purchasing goods from wholesalers and manufacturers, and then selling those goods to consumers in retail stores or over the Internet. When a shoplifter steals an item from a retailer, the business can no longer sell that item to consumers to pay for the purchasing cost of it, as well as other expenses like rent and employee wages. Depending on a store’s profit margin, it may have to sell dozens of units to make up for the revenue that is lost due to the stolen items. For instance, if a store has a two percent profit margin and a shoplifter steals an item that is worth $10, then the store will have to sell $500 worth of goods to recover the loss.  
Shoplifting not only causes harm to retailers, but also has a negative effect on customers. Since businesses lose profit due to shoplifting, they may set prices higher than they would otherwise do to compensate for the losses. In a sense, shoplifting acts as a tax on retailers that is ultimately passed on to consumers. Small businesses that raise prices may lose customers to larger competitors, who are often better equipped to absorb losses and keep their prices low. 
Retail businesses can adopt a variety of measures to prevent theft and fight against shoplifting. Common prevention methods include: posting warning signs that shoplifters will be punished, installing security cameras, training employees to be aware of shoplifting, and putting security devices on products. Other measures like locking products away in display cases can also help to prevent shoplifting of valuable items. 
商店失窃是零售企业面临的常见问题，可能对它们的盈利能力产生不利影响。零售企业通过从批发商和制造商购买商品，并在零售店或通过互联网将这些商品销售给消费者来赚取收入。当一个顾客从零售商那里偷窃商品时，企业无法再将该商品销售给消费者，以支付采购成本及其他费用如租金和员工工资。根据商店的利润率，可能需要销售多个单位来弥补因被盗商品而失去的收入。例如，如果一家商店的利润率为百分之二，而一名顾客偷走价值10美元的商品，则该商店需要销售总价值500美元的商品来弥补损失。
商店失窃不仅对零售商造成伤害，还对顾客产生负面影响。由于商家因失窃而损失利润，它们可能会比原本预期的定价更高，以弥补损失。在某种程度上，失窃行为对零售商起到一种税收作用，最终转嫁给消费者。提高价格的小型企业可能会失去顾客，而大型竞争对手通常能够更好地吸收损失并保持低价。
零售企业可以采取多种措施来防止盗窃和打击商店失窃。常见的预防方法包括：张贴警告标志表明将对盗窃者进行惩罚、安装安全摄像头、培训员工以警惕失窃行为，以及对产品安装安全设备。其他措施如将有价值的商品锁在展示柜中也有助于防止其被盗。

M: I love this song, “Starry Starry Night”! I wonder who wrote it. 
W: Oh! That’s a song from 1971 by a famous American songwriter, Don McLean. But do you know what it’s about? 
M: No. Not really. I just like the words about the starry night. 
W: It’s a great story! The song says “Starry Starry Night” because it’s about the famous Dutch  painter, Vincent van Gogh, who lived more than 100 years ago. 
M: Oh! I’ve always liked Van Gogh’s art work, especially his Starry Night painting. But why did  Don McLean write the song about Van Gogh over 80 years after Van Gogh died? 
W: Well, the songwriter, Don McLean, read a book that told the story of the passionate life of Van  Gogh. He loved painting–but people didn’t understand him or his art. Did you know that Van  Gogh painted around 2,000 paintings but only sold one of them in his lifetime? 
M: Gosh. That is a sad story, especially since his paintings are incredibly popular today. Let’s  see ... Wow! A Van Gogh painting today is worth around 100 million dollars! 
W: I know. And, listen to this: The songwriter, Don McLean, had 72 attempts to finally get a  company who would produce his first music album. 
M: What? 72 attempts? 
W: Uh-huh. That’s right. All companies said “No, no, no” before one finally said “Yes! We love your music!” 
M: That’s amazing. That’s a lot of “No’s!” to get to the one “Yes” he needed! 
W: Yeah! I think that’s another reason Don McLean wrote the song about Van Gogh. They both  had to work so hard on their art for people to notice them. 
M: Wow! All right. Turn up the volume. Let’s listen again. 
W: Wonderful … So, three cheers to the artists that never give up and keep on trying! 
M: 我喜欢这首歌，“星空璀璨的夜晚”！不知道是谁写的。
W: 哦！那是1971年由著名的美国歌手唱作家唐·麦克林创作的。但你知道这首歌是关于什么的吗？
M: 不太清楚。我只是喜欢歌词里讲述的星空夜晚。
W: 这是一个很棒的故事！这首歌叫“星空璀璨的夜晚”，因为它讲述的是荷兰著名画家文森特·梵高，他生活在100多年前。
M: 哦！我一直喜欢梵高的艺术作品，尤其是他的《星夜》画作。但为什么唐·麦克林会在梵高去世80多年后写这首歌呢？
W: 唐·麦克林这位歌手读了一本书，讲述了梵高那种充满激情的生活故事。他热爱绘画，但人们不理解他和他的艺术。你知道梵高绘制了大约2000幅画作，但一生只卖出了一幅吗？
M: 天啊。那真是个悲伤的故事，特别是他的画作今天如此受欢迎。
W: 我知道。还有，听这个：唐·麦克林为了终于让一家公司制作他的第一张音乐专辑，尝试了72次。
M: 什么？72次？
W: 嗯。没错。所有公司都说“不，不，不”，直到最后一家公司说“是的！我们喜欢你的音乐！”
M: 真是太不可思议了。那么多的“不”之后，他终于得到了他需要的那个“是”！
W: 是啊！我想这也是唐·麦克林写这首关于梵高的歌的另一个原因。他们都必须为了让人们注意到他们而努力工作。
M: 哇！好的。把音量调大，我们再听一遍。
W: 太棒了……所以，为那些永不放弃，不断努力的艺术家们干杯吧！
## Passage 1
More than one million schoolchildren in the United States have gone through a program called Reading Recovery. The program is for six-year-olds who are struggling to learn to read. According to the Reading Recovery Council of North America, an association dedicated to literacy education in North America, more than 20 percent of United States public schools are using the program to help their first-grade students, and more than 99 percent of the students in the program passed the state reading examination. 
The method used by Reading Recovery calls for a reading teacher to work with children one at a time. The lessons take half an hour each schoolday. The teacher helps students with reading, writing and the study of the alphabet. Reading Recovery lessons last for 12 to 20 weeks. During the lessons, the teacher looks for ways that the child learns best. Then he or she works to help the student develop effective strategies to solve their problems in reading. The idea behind this practice is for students to continue to use and extend these strategies each time they read. 
Students participating in the program read many short books. Some of the books are written in a way similar to spoken language. They also read and write stories in their own words. The material gets harder with time. The lessons end when the student’s reading ability reaches the average level of the class. The Reading Recovery Council says 80 percent of students who finish the lessons can read and write within their class average. 
However, not all schools embrace the Reading Recovery method happily. Some criticize it, saying that the cost of this method is much higher than other types of programs. But supporters say it saves money in the long run. They think it helps prevent the sad results and expense of letting children fail in school.

在美国，超过一百万名学童参与了名为“阅读复苏”（Reading Recovery）的教育项目。这个项目专为六岁的学生设计，帮助他们克服阅读困难。根据北美阅读复苏委员会的数据，超过20%的美国公立学校采用了这个项目来帮助一年级的学生，超过99%的参与项目的学生通过了州级阅读考试。
阅读复苏的教学方法要求阅读教师一对一地指导学生。每个教学日的课程持续半小时。教师帮助学生提升阅读、写作和字母学习能力。阅读复苏的课程通常持续12到20周。在教学过程中，教师寻找最适合学生的学习方式，然后帮助学生发展解决阅读问题的有效策略。这一实践的理念是让学生每次阅读时都能继续使用和拓展这些策略。
参与项目的学生阅读许多简短的书籍。其中一些书籍的写作风格类似口语。他们还用自己的话语阅读和写作故事。随着时间的推移，难度会逐渐增加。当学生的阅读能力达到班级平均水平时，阅读复苏的课程就会结束。阅读复苏委员会称，80%完成课程的学生能够达到班级平均水平的阅读和写作能力。
